**Filters Now Require a Consensus**

Previously if a test case met a single filter, it would run. Now a test case must
meet all defined filters to run. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./vendor/bin/demeanor --filter-name SomeTest --include-group aGroup

Only tests with *SomeTest* in their name that belong to the group *aGroup** will
run.
